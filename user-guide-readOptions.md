## Controlling the input JSON using `ReadOptions`
Create a new`ReadOptions`instance and turn various features on/off using the methods below. Example:

    ReadOptions readOptions = new ReadOptionsBuilder().feature1().feature2(args).build()
    JsonIo.toObjects(root, readOptions, rootClass);

To pass read options to `JsonIo.toObjects(root, readOptions, rootClass),` set up a `ReadOptions` instance using the
`ReadOptionsBuilder.` You can view the Javadoc on the `ReadOptionsBuilder` class for detailed information. The
`ReadOptions` are created and made read-only by calling the `.build()` method on the `ReadOptionsBuilder.` You can have
multiple `ReadOptions` instances for different scenarios, and safely re-use them once built (their stateless). A 
`ReadOptions` instance can be created from another `ReadOptions` instance by using `new ReadOptionsBuilder(readOptionsToCopyFrom).`

### Constructors
Create new instances of`ReadOptions.`
>#### new ReadOptionsBuilder().feature1().feature2(args).build()
>- [ ] Start with default options and add in feature1 and feature2(requires argument) and make read-only.
>#### new ReadOptionsBuilder(`ReadOptions other`)
>- [ ] Copy all settings from the passed in 'other'`ReadOptions.`

### Class Loader
The`ClassLoader`in the`ReadOptons`is used by json-io to turn `String` class names into`Class`instances.
>#### `ClassLoader`getClassLoader()
>- [ ] Returns the ClassLoader to resolve String class names into Class instances.

>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder`classLoader(`ClassLoader loader`)
>- [ ] Sets the ClassLoader to resolve String class names when reading JSON. Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.

### Unknown Types
When reading JSON, what do you want to happen when a class name does not exist in your JVM? Should the parsing fail?
This feature allows you to control what happens here.  You can tell it to fail on an unknown type (default behavior) and
a`JsonIoException`will be thrown. Turn this feature off, and the parser will create a`LinkedHashMap`and use that
to store the content from the JSON object being read.  If you want, you can set your own class to be created
instead of a`LinkedHashMap,`however, it should be noted that`Maps`are useful because any field encountered in the
JSON can be`put`into a`Map.`
>#### `boolean`isFailOnUnknownType()
>- [ ] Returns`true` if an 'unknownTypeClass' is set,`false`if it is not set
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` failOnUnknownType(`boolean fail`)
>- [ ] Set to`true`to indicate that an exception should be thrown if an unknown class type is encountered,`false`otherwise.
   If`fail`is`false,`then the default class used will be`LinkedHashMap` for the particular JSON object encountered. You can
   set this to your own class using the`unknownTypeClass()`feature. Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.
>####  `Class` getUnknownTypeClass()
>- [ ] Get the Class used to store content when the indicated class cannot be loaded by the JVM.  Defaults to`null.` When`null`, `LinkedHashMap` is used. It is usually best to use a `Map` derivative, as it will be able to have the various field names encountered to be 'set' into it.
>####  `ReadOptions`unknownTypeClass(`Class`)
>- [ ] Set the class to use (defaults to`LinkedHashMap.class`) when a JSON object is encountered and there is no
   corresponding Java class to instantiate to receive the values. Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.

### MaxDepth - Security protection
Set the maximum object nesting level so that no`StackOverflowExceptions`happen.  Instead, you will get a`JsonIoException`letting
you know that the maximum object nesting level has been reached.
> #### `int` getMaxDepth()
>- [ ] Return the max nesting depth for JSON {...}
> #### `ReadOptionsBuilder` maxDepth(`int depth`)
>- [ ] Set the max depth to allow for nested JSON {...}.  Set this to prevent security risk from`StackOverflow`attack
>- vectors. Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.

### Floating Point Options
Although the JSON spec does not support Nan and Infinity, it can be convenient to allow it in the JSON, and have
the values be both written and read properly. This feature is off by default.  Although the JSON with Nan and Infinity may 
work for your application, keep in mind, NaN, +Inf, -Inf are not necessarily going to be supported by other APIs and services.
> #### `boolean`isAllowNanAndInfinity
>- [ ] Returns`true`if set to allow serialization of`NaN`and`Infinity`for`doubles`and`floats.`
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` allowNanAndInfinity(`boolean allow`)
>- [ ] true will allow`doubles`and`floats`to be output as`NaN`and`INFINITY`,`false`and these values will come across
   as`null.` Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.

### Close Stream
Sometimes you want to close the stream automatically after reading, other times you may want to leave it open to read
additional JSON from the stream.  For example, NDJSON is a format of {...}\n{...}\{...} To read this format, you can tell
`JsonIo` not to close the `InputStream` after each read.  See example at the beginning of the user guide.
>#### `boolean`isCloseStream()
>- [ ] Returns `true` if set to automatically close stream after read (the default), or `false`to leave stream open after reading from it.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` closeStream(`boolean closeStream`)
>- [ ] Sets the 'closeStream' setting,`true`to turn on,`false`will turn off. The default setting is`false.` Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.

### Aliasing - shorten class names in @type.
Aliasing is used to turn long java package names to simple class names, e.g. `java.util.ArrayList` becomes `ArrayList`
in the JSON.  By default, json-io has most of the common JDK classes aliased to make the JSON content smaller.  You can
add additional aliases for classes in your program.
>#### `String` getTypeNameAlias(`String typeName`)
>- [ ] Alias Type Names, e.g. "ArrayList" instead of "java.util.ArrayList".
>#### `Map<String, String>` aliasTypeNames()
>- [ ] Returns `Map<String, String>` containing String class names to alias names. Use this API to see default aliases.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` aliasTypeNames(`Map<String, String> aliasTypeNames`)
>- [ ] Puts the`Map`containing String class names to alias names. The passed in`Map`will be `putAll()` copied overwriting any
entries that match values in the passed in Map. New entries in the Map are added.  Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` aliasTypeName(`String typeName, String alias`)
>- [ ] Sets the alias for a given class name. Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` aliasTypeName(`Class, String alias`)
>- [ ] Sets the alias for a given class. Returns`ReadOptions`for chained access.

### Class Coercion
Use this feature to turn classes like`java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableRandomAccessList`into an`ArrayList`when parsed and loaded 
into memory.  There are many derivative classes for collection singleton's, synchronized variations of collections, and unmodifiable
variations.  All the common JDK substitutions are already in the coercion list.  You can add more if needed.
>#### `boolean`isClassCoerced(`String className`)
>- [ ] Return`true`if the passed in Class name is being coerced to another type, `false`otherwise.
>#### `Class` getCoercedClass(`Class`) 
>- [ ] Fetch the coerced class for the passed in fully qualified class name.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` coerceClass(`String sourceClassName, Class destClass`)
>- [ ] Coerce a class from one type (named in the JSON) to another type.  For example, converting
`java.util.Collections$SingletonSet`to a`LinkedHashSet.class.`

### Missing Field Handler
When an attempt to set a value from the JSON onto a Java object is made, but the field from the JSON is not
available on the Java object, the missing field handler feature comes into play.  You can set the handler to be
notified of the missing field. It will be notified of all missing fields at the end of deserialization. 
See`JsonReader.MissingFieldHandler`for more information.
>#### `JsonReader.MissingFieldHandler`getMissingFieldHandler()
>- [ ]  Fetch the method that will be called when a field in the JSON is read in, yet there is no corresponding 
field on the destination object to receive the value.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` missingFieldHandler(`JsonReader.MissingFieldHandler missingFieldHandler`)
>- [ ] Pass the`missing field handler`to be called when a field in the JSON is read in, yet there is no corresponding field on the 
destination object to receive the value.

### Class Factory
For a class that is failing to instantiate or be read in correctly by the default processing of json-io, you can
associate a`ClassFactory`to a`Class` to remedy the situation. The`ClassFactory's`job is to create instances of the
associated class, and load the values from the JSON into the class from the JSON object being encountered at the 
time (it is passed to the`ClassFactory`). This is the preferred method for custom handling a class as opposed to using a`CustomReader.`
>#### `Map<Class, JsonReader.ClassFactory>`getClassFactories()
>- [ ] Fetch`Map`of all Class's associated to`JsonReader.ClassFactory's.`
>#### `JsonReader.ClassFactory`getClassFactory(`Class`)
>- [ ] Get the`ClassFactory`associated to the passed in class.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` setClassFactories(`Map<Class, ? extends JsonReader.ClassFactory> factories`)
>- [ ] Associate multiple ClassFactory instances to Classes that needs help being constructed and read in. The
`Map`of entries associate`Class`to`ClassFactory.` The`ClassFactory`class knows how to instantiate and load
the class associated to it.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` addClassFactory(`Class clazz, JsonReader.ClassFactory factory`)
>- [ ] Associate a`ClassFactory`to a`Class`that needs help being constructed and read in. If you use this method
more than once for the same class, the last`ClassFactory`associated to the class will overwrite any prior associations.
 
### Custom Readers
Custom readers can be added to load the JSON content associated to a particular class if the default loading is
not working.  Before using a`CustomReader,`we recommend using a `ClassFactory,`as that allows your code to not
only create the appropriate instance, but also to load it at the same time. `CustomReaders` are used for 
the associated class and any derived classes.  If that picks up a class you do not want to associate to a `CustomReader,`
then can add that class to the Not-Custom-Reader list.
>#### `Map<Class, JsonReader.JsonClassReader>`getCustomReaderClasses()
>- [ ] Fetch`Map`of`Class`to custom`JsonClassReader's` used to read JSON when the class is encountered during
 serialization to JSON.  This is the entire`Map`of Custom Readers.
>#### `boolean`isCustomReaderClass(`Class`)
>- [ ] Return`true`if there is a custom reader class associated to the passed in class, `false` otherwise.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` setCustomReaderClasses(`Map<? extends Class>, ? extends JsonReader.JsonClassReader> customReaderClasses`)
>- [ ]  Set all custom readers at once.  Pass in a`Map`of`Class`to`JsonReader.JsonClassReader.` Set the passed 
in`Map`as the established`Map`of custom readers to be used when reading JSON. Using this method  more than once, will
set the custom readers to only the values from the`Map`in the last call made.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` addCustomReaderClass(`Class, JsonReader.JsonClassReader customReader`)
> - [ ] Add a single association of a class to a custom reader.  If you add another associated reader to the same class, the last one added will overwrite the prior association.

### Not Custom Reader
Add a class to this list that you do not want being associated to a`CustomReader.` This list is only used when you
want to turn-off a`CustomReader`for a particular class that is inadvertently being associated to a `CustomReader` through inheritance.
>#### `boolean`isNotCustomReaderClass(`Class`)
>- [ ]  Pass in Class to check if it's on the not-customized list.  Classes are added to this list when a class is being 
picked up through inheritance, and you don't want it to have a custom reader associated to it.
>#### `Set<Class<?>>`getNotCustomReadClasses()
>- [ ] Fetch the`Set`of all Classes on the not-customized list. 
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` addNotCustomReaderClass(`Class notCustomClass`) 
>- [ ] Add a class to the not-customized list - the list of classes that you do not want to be picked up by
a custom reader (that could happen through inheritance). 
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` setNotCustomReaderClasses(`Collection<Class> notCustomClasses`) 
>- [ ] Initialize the list of classes on the non-customized list.  All prior associations will be dropped and this 
`Collection` will establish the new list.

### Non-Referenceable Classes (Opposite of Instance Folding)
For small immutable classes, no need to use @id/@ref with them, as they are effectively primitives.  All primitives,
primitive wrappers, BigInteger, BigDecimal, Atomic*, java.util.Date, String, Class, are automatically marked
as non-referenceable. You can add more immutable classes of your own.  The side-effect of this is that it could change
the "shape" of your graph, if you were counting on two different fields that point to the same String/BigDecimal/Integer
to have the same == instance.  Rarely a concern, however, if you have a lot of the same value, say Integer(0) and expect
all those to collapse to the same value, they won't Each one would be read in as its own instance.
>#### `boolean`isNonReferenceableClass(`Class`)
>- [ ] Checks if a class is non-referenceable. Returns`true`if the passed in class is considered a non-referenceable class.
>#### `Collection<Class>` getNonReferenceableClasses()
>- [ ] Returns a`Collection`of all non-referenceable classes.
>#### `ReadOptionsBuilder` addNonReferenceableClass(`Class`)
>- [ ] Adds a class to be considered "non-referenceable." Examples are the built-in primitives.
